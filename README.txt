Readme
------

Tagadelic provides an API which allows developers to easily create
tagclouds, weighted lists, search-clouds and such.

With this API, two very simple modules are shipped that implement this, for your
ease and reference. Since the project is mostly a library, it is  mostly aimed
at developers who should use it as a library. 

But end-users can install and use the shipped modules right out of the box too.

* Create a tagcloud from taxonomy terms: terms used more often become
  larger, terms used less frequent are smaller.
* Create a weighted list of article-titles, based on the amount of
  "hits" they got.
